## üß© Overview

**ZeroWave_FlipperZero-BlueJammer** is the official firmware port of the **[ESP32‚ÄëBlueJammer](https://github.com/EmenstaNougat/ESP32-BlueJammer)** project, built to run on the **[ZeroWave extension board](https://www.elecrow.com/flipper-zero-zerowave-extension-board.html)** for the Flipper Zero.
<img width="1074" height="506" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1186de40-0b2a-48d5-8ed8-cf499c339227" />
This project allows you to use the Flipper Zero as a user‚Äëinterface and control hub for the jamming hardware, enabling selectable modes via the directional pad while managing power safely.

The ZeroWave is designed as an **educational tool** to explore RF communication, protocol interference, and hardware control, under the strict caveat of responsible usage and full legal compliance.

## üß† Features

- üéÆ **Flipper Zero App Integration**  
  Use your Flipper Zero directional pad to select modes:  
  - **Up** ‚Üí Bluetooth  
  - **Right** ‚Üí Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)  
  - **Down** ‚Üí WiFi  
  - **Left** ‚Üí RC (remote‚Äëcontrol systems)  
  - **OK** ‚Üí Idle (no jamming)  
  - **Back** ‚Üí Exit the app & safely power down the ZeroWave board  

- ‚ö° **Managed 5‚ÄØV Rail Activation**  
  The firmware handles enabling the 5‚ÄØV rail that powers the RF modules, ensuring stable voltage and safe operation.

- üîê **Dual nRF24 Interface Support**  
  Supports two RF modules (e.g., GT24‚ÄëMini or Ebyte E01‚Äë2G4M27SX), enabling effective channel interferance across the whole 2.4‚ÄØGHz band.

  **Example device‚Äëtypes that can be affected include:**

  - Bluetooth speakers (wireless audio devices)
  
  - Smartwatches and fitness trackers using Bluetooth or BLE
  
  - IoT devices operating in the 2.4‚ÄØGHz band (smart plugs, sensors, smart locks)
  
  - WiFi devices such as wireless security cameras and routers set on the 2.4‚ÄØGHz channel
  
  - Wireless gamepads/controllers (e.g., Bluetooth or 2.4‚ÄØGHz dongle gamepads - DualShock, DualSense, Xbox, etc. controllers) 
  
  - Remote‚Äëcontrol (RC) drones, cars, toys that operate at ~2.4‚ÄØGHz
  
  - Wireless keyboards/mice or proprietary peripherals using 2.4‚ÄØGHz dongles

  - And way more, in short "ANYTHING OPERATING ON 2.4GHz!"

- üì° **Multi‚ÄëMode Jamming Capability**  
  By selecting different modes, you can experiment with jamming Bluetooth classic, BLE, WiFi, and RC frequencies, all on controlled hardware setup, for learning purposes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

### Step‚ÄØ1: Flash the Firmware  
Download the latest `.bin` from the Releases section of the repo and flash it using `esptool.py` or a suitable ESP32 flash tool.

```bash
esptool.py --chip esp32c3 write_flash 0x0000 ZeroWave.ino.bin
````

### Step‚ÄØ2: Connect to the Flipper Zero

* Insert the ZeroWave board into your Flipper Zero‚Äôs expansion port.
* Ensure it‚Äôs properly seated and powered.
* On the Flipper Zero, open the ‚ÄúESP32‚ÄëBlueJammer‚Äù app (installed as part of the overall ecosystem).

### Step‚ÄØ3: Use the App

Use the directional pad to select your jamming mode:

```
‚Üë = Bluetooth  
‚Üí = BLE  
‚Üì = WiFi  
‚Üê = RC systems  
OK = Idle mode (no jamming)  
Back = Exit & power down board  
```

The firmware will handle powering down the 5‚ÄØV rail safely when you exit, ensuring your hardware is not left in an unsafe state.

## üß© Technical Details & Architecture

* **Platform:** ESP32‚ÄëC3 SuperMini (32‚Äëbit RISC‚ÄëV core)
* **SPI Interfaces:** connected to both nRF24 modules
* **Voltage Management:** 5‚ÄØV rail activation via Flipper Zero expansion + full firmware control
* **App Interface:** Flipper Zero directs commands communicating with the firmware
* **Channel Hopping Logic:** Firmware interferes through a defined set of channels for each mode (Bluetooth classic, BLE, WiFi, RC) for maximal coverage.

### Firmware Structure Highlights

* `ZeroWave.cpp` - Entry point that initializes SPI bus, dual‚ÄØnRF24 modules and orchestrates mode switching & logics.
* `ZeroWaveBlueJammer.h` / `ZeroWaveBlueJammer.cpp` - Core jamming logic: channel sets, interferance routines and mode‚Äëspecific behaviour.
* `FlipperToBoardCom.h` / `FlipperToBoardCom.cpp` - Communication interface between the Flipper Zero and the expansion board: handles D‚Äëpad commands, mode selection and status feedback.
* `Powermanagement.h` / `Powermanagement.cpp` - Manages the 5‚ÄØV rail: safe powering‚Äëon of the hardware, and clean powering‚Äëoff when exiting the app.
